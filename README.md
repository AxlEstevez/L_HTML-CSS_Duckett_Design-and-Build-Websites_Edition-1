# Duckett, Jon - Design and Build Websites - Edition 1

# Honestly, all the source code is on the textbook website
# http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/
# I'm a hoarder, so I keep the practice code I write sometimes
# I added notes and stylistic changes every now and then, but
# other than that, there is no reason to use my code over the
# one in the link.
