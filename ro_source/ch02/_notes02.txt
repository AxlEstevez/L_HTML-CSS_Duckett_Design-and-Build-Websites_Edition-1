# HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page
# (e.g.) headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

# They also provide semantic information (e.g.) where emphasis should be
# placed the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

###

# <h1>, <h2>,... <h6> = Heading. HTML has 6 "levels" of heading. <h1> are main headings
# while <h2> are subheadings, along with the other sub-sub headings (3, 4, 5, 6).
# Sizes can be modified with CSS

# <p> = Paragraph. Each paragraph is on a new line with space in between
# it an subsequent paragraphs

# <b> = Bold.

# <i> = Italic.

# <sup> = Superscript

# <sub> = Subscript

# White Space. If there is more than one whitespace in an element, it is collapsed
# to be displayed as only one space

# <br /> = Line Break. New line indicator.

# <hr /> = Horizontal rule. Adds a horizontal line that spans across the window.

# <strong> = Strong. Indicates content has strong importance. Also makes it bold.

# <em> = Emphasis. Indicates content has subtly different meaning. Also makes it italic.

# <blockquote> = Block Quote. Used for longer quotes. <p> is still used in element.
# indents entire <p>, but if should not be used solely to indent (use CSS instead).

# <q> = Quote. Used for shorter quotes that can be used within <p>. Some browsers put
# double quotation marks to indicate quote. (<q> and <blockquote> can have a "cite"
# attribute, whose value should be a link with more information about the quote.

# <abbr> Abbreviation. Intended for abbreviations or acronyms. Has a "title" parameter
# that allows you to specify the full term.

# <acronym> Acronym. Similar to <abbr>, but deprecated in HTML5. Intended for ONLY
# acronyms in HTML4, but is generally replaced by <abbr>.

# <cite> Citation. Allows you to cite the location of a referenced piece of work,
# such as a book, film or research paper. Not intended for use with a person's name in
# HTML5, but was sometimes done so in HTML4. Content is italicized.

# <dfn> Definition. Used to indicate the defining (initial) instance of a new key term.
# Often displays content in italics.

# <address> Address. Used to contain the contact info of the author (email, phone,
# and/or physical address). Often displays content in italics.

# <ins> Insert. Shows that content has been recently inserted into a document. Content often underlined.
# <del> Delete. Shows that content has been recently deleted. Content often has a line through it.
