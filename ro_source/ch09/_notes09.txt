# Flash allows you to add animations, video and audio to the web.

# Flash is not supported on iPhone or iPad.

# HTML5 introduces new <video> and <audio> elements for adding video and audio to web pages,
# but these are only supported in the latest browsers.

# Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not support all the same video and audio formats,
# so you need to supply your files in different formats to ensure that everyone can see/hear them.
