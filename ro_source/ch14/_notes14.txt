# In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
# there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

# List markers can be given different appearances using they list-style-type and list-style image properties.

# Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can
# use to control them and make them more consistent.

# Forms are easier to use of the from controls are vertically aligned using CSS.

# Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.
