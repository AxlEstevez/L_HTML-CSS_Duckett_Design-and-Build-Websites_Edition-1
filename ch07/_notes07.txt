# Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form,
# which lives inside a form element.

# Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs,

# Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types or the values
# of the options they select are sent to the server.

# HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms
